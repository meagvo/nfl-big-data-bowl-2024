At a basic level, tackling is crucial to the game of football in several ways:
 - **Preventing yards gained:** Defensive tackling is a key way to prevent the offensive team from gaining additiongl yardage. When executed at the right moment, a successful tackle can put the opposing team in unfavorable conditions.
 - **Preventing scoring:** When every point counts, a successful tackle can make the difference between winning and losing a game. By preventing a player from reaching the end zone and forcing the opposing team to attempt field goals, tacklers limit points scored.
 - **Creating turnovers:** If a defender can tackle effectively and lead to a forced fumble, their own team can gain posession of the ball and get the chance to score more points.


### Project Goal:
Our goal is to analyze historical tracking data and extract meaningful features to predict when a tackle attempt will be successful. We will then apply the model to players and determine their "Raw Tackle Ability", which we define as "the probability that a player will make a successful tackle based on their previous behavior."

We also introduce the "Tackle Index", which allows us to rank players based on their current track record related to tackling in addition to their Raw Tackle Ability (RTA). This accounts for consistent performance and number of games played.
